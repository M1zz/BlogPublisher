# Why I Started a Tech Blog

Today I'm writing my first blog post. I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now, but kept putting it off until today.

## The Trigger

Honestly, it started with something small. One day during a code review at work, a senior developer asked me, "Why did you write it this way?" I couldn't answer. I just wrote it because it worked. That moment was embarrassing. It was my own code, and I couldn't explain it.

After that day, I knew something had to change. But I didn't know where to start. I'd read books but forget everything quickly. I'd watch tutorials but the knowledge would vanish if I didn't use it in practice.

## Why Blogging?

At first, I tried organizing my notes in Notion. But since only I could see it, I ended up writing carelessly. "I'll clean this up later," I'd tell myself, and the messy notes just piled up. Eventually, I never looked at them again.

Then I stumbled upon someone's blog post that was incredibly clear. I had struggled with the exact same problem, but this person had neatly explained why the issue occurred and how to solve it. That's when it hit me: when you write to explain to others, you can't be sloppy about it.

## The Platform Dilemma

After deciding to blog, I spent two weeks just choosing a platform. It seems trivial, but the more I researched, the harder the decision became.

### The Candidates

Here are the platforms I initially considered:

**Tistory**
Seemed to be the most popular in Korea. Good exposure on Naver search, large Korean community. But it requires a Kakao account, and the invitation system was annoying. Customizing the design meant dealing with HTML/CSS directly, which felt like too much hassle.

**Velog**
Popular among Korean developers these days. Clean UI with good Markdown support. But you can't connect a custom domain. I wanted to run my blog on my own domain eventually, so that was a dealbreaker.

**Medium**
Famous in the English-speaking world. Beautiful design and pleasant reading experience. But Korean content gets almost no exposure there. Plus, the free article limit makes it inconvenient for readers.

**GitHub Pages + Jekyll**
Setting it up yourself means complete customization freedom, which was tempting. But I knew the setup would take forever. I wanted to write blog posts, not spend all my time configuring. Passed on this one.

**DEV.to**
An international developer community. Posts get immediate exposure to developers, which is a plus. But again, no custom domain support.

### What I Actually Wanted

Comparing platforms helped me clarify what I really needed:

1. **Custom domain support** - I wanted to run the blog on my own domain. Even if I switch platforms later, I wanted the URLs to stay consistent.

2. **Search visibility** - No point writing if nobody reads it. Posts needed to show up on Google.

3. **Markdown support** - Code blocks and syntax highlighting had to work well. It's a dev blog, after all.

4. **Simple setup** - I didn't want to waste time configuring the blog. I just wanted to focus on writing.

5. **Free** - It's a hobby project. I didn't want to pay.

## Hashnode It Is

After comparing everything, I settled on Hashnode. Honestly, I hadn't even heard of it before, but found it while researching.

### Why I Chose It

**Free custom domain**
This was the biggest factor. Other platforms charge for custom domains, but Hashnode offers it for free. You can connect your domain and run it as `blog.mydomain.com`. SSL certificates are automatically provisioned too.

**Great Google search visibility**
I discovered this after actually using it. A few days after posting, my articles started appearing in Google search results. You can configure SEO settings per post, including meta tags. Sitemaps are automatically generated.

**Excellent Markdown editor**
When writing in Markdown, you get a real-time preview. Code block syntax highlighting works great for different languages. Image uploads are drag-and-drop, and they're hosted on Hashnode's CDN, so no need to worry about image hosting.

**Developer community**
Since Hashnode is specifically a developer blogging platform, your posts get exposed on the Hashnode feed. With some luck, other developers might discover your content. Though admittedly, most content is in English, so Korean posts don't get as much exposure.

**GitHub integration**
You can back up your posts to a GitHub repository. Even if the blogging platform goes down or changes its policies, your content stays safe in your own repo.

**Dead simple setup**
Sign up, choose a blog name, and you're done. There are a few themes to pick from, and even the default design looks clean enough without any customization.

### The Downsides

Being honest, there are drawbacks:

- Almost no Korean users, so finding Korean-language resources is difficult
- Doesn't seem to get indexed well on Naver (Google works great though)
- Community features are English-centric, so Korean posts get less exposure

But Google search visibility and custom domain support mattered more to me, so I accepted these tradeoffs.

## I'm Actually Scared

Now that I'm about to launch a public blog, I'm scared. What if I write something wrong? What if someone comments "This is incorrect"? That would be embarrassing.

But I'm going to start anyway. If I'm wrong, I'll fix it. Actually, if someone points out my mistakes, that's a learning opportunity. If I only write when I'm 100% sure, I'll never write anything.

---

## What Will I Write About?

Nothing fancy. Just things I struggled with, things I learned, things that confused me until I wrote them out and finally understood.

I'll probably write mostly about Swift and iOS development. I've been learning SwiftUI lately and have plenty of debugging adventures to document.

I hope future me finds these posts helpful. And maybe, with some luck, they'll help someone else who's stuck on the same problems.

That's it for today. It's my first post, so I just wrote whatever came to mind.
